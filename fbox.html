          Engineering services encompass a broad range of specialized consulting
          and technical support activities that apply engineering principles to
          solve problems and achieve project goals. These services can include
          design and development, project management, technical consulting,
          testing and quality control, and documentation.</span

          >Natural gas is found in both associated formations, meaning it is
          formed and produced with oil, and non-associated reservoirs. Gas can
          either be dry (pure methane), or wet (exists with other hydrocarbons
          like butane). Although wet gas must be treated to remove the other
          hydrocarbons and other condensates before it can be transported, it
          can increase producers' revenues because they can sell those removed
          products.</span

          organisms or parts of this to develop or create different products.
          Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within
          the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to
          produce the desired product).</span

          diagnosis, case management, monitoring and treatment or surveillance
          of communicable, noncommunicable, neglected tropical and rare
          diseases, injuries and disabilities. Therefore, equitable access to
          safe, effective and quality assured diagnostics requires a
          comprehensive health-systems approach that addresses all stages of the
          access value chain.</span
